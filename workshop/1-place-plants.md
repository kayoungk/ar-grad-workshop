# Plant placement

By the end of this part, you will have an understanding how your phone can interact with the real world to place objects on the ground.

## 1. Create a "prefab" for your plant.

First thing to do is to create your plant model - this is what will get placed on the ground.

<details>
<summary>Download a 3d model and drag it into your assets folder to import it</summary>

![Import plant](!./img/import-assets.gif)

</details>

<details>
<summary>In your scene, right click an empty area, and choose "Create Empty".  Rename it and ensure it is not transformed in any way.</summary>

![Create Empty](!./img/plant-base-object.gif)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Drag the model under your plant game object, and resize to a reasonable size for your scene.</summary>

![Add plant to scene](!./add-plant-to-scene.gif)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Create a prefab out of the plant by dragging the root object into the Prefabs folder.</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Delete the plant from the scene</summary>
</details>

## 2. THE REST

TO DO

* Write a script that runs on tap
* Do a raycast
* Instantiate the plant at the right spot
