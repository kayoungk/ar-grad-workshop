# AR Starter

This project is a little starter - comes with ARFoundation, ARCore, ARKit and a mostly empty first scene to verify it works.

If this works, you're on your way!

## Prerequisites

* Unity 2019.3.0f3 or higher (use Unity Hub)
* Include "Android" or "iOS" build support as desired
  * Also whatever native SDKs you need for these - eg. XCode, Android SDK, whatever
  * You may need to point your Unity install at the right folder - see `Edit` -> `Preferences` -> `External Tools`

## How to run

* Open the project up
* Choose your platform
* Hit build and run
